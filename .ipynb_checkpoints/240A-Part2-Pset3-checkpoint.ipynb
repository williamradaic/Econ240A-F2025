    "**2.1.** The Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm is a computationally efficient procedure to approximate posterior distributions when exact computations are intractable. \n",
    "In the problem at hand, we have specified prior subjective uncertainty over the parameters $\\phi$ and $\\sigma^2$, and want to use the data to compute the posterior distribution of these parameters.\n",
    "In order to construct this posterior distribution, we need to approximate more draws from this posterior, since the observed data corresponds to just a single draw.\n",
    "The key reason why the procedure works is that the Markov Chain induced by the algorithm converges to a stationary distribution as $s$ grows---i.e., converges to the posterior distribution. Thus, we can approximate draws from the posterior and construct its distribution.\n",
    "$\\theta'$ is always accepted whenever $\\alpha > 1$---i.e., whenever the likelihood ratio for the new parameter is larger than 1. This means that the new parameter $\\theta'$ is an improvement (in terms of likelihood) relative to $\\theta$. If $\\alpha < 1$, the new parameter will be adopted with positive probability given by the CDF of a Uniform(0,1) evaluated at $\\alpha$; that is, whenever $\\theta'$ leads to a reduction in likelihood, it can still be adopted with some positive probability. The reasoning behind this decision rule is that it allows for the algorithm to visit all the parameter space and not get stuck in local minima."

In other words, increasing $\\kappa$ in the implementation of the algorithm leads to a more dispersed search process, visiting more regions of the parameter space with higher frequency.
